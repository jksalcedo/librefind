## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services.

### A. Device & Usage Data (Anonymous)

When you scan your device, we collect the following **anonymized** data to generate your sovereignty
score:

* **Device ID:** A randomly generated unique identifier (UUID) stored locally on your device. This
  allows us to sync your preferences without tracking your real identity.
* **App Statistics:** The total count of installed apps, count of FOSS (Free and Open Source
  Software) apps, count of proprietary apps, and count of unknown/unclassified apps.
    * *Note: We send your installed app package names to our servers solely for classification
      purposes (determining FOSS vs. proprietary status). We do not store or log these package names
      beyond what is necessary for the query.*
* **App Version:** The version of LibreFind you are using.

### B. Account Data (Optional)

If you choose to create an account to contribute alternatives or sync data, we collect:

  plaintext password.

  database.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data for the following purposes:

* **To Provide the Service:** Calculating your "Sovereignty Score" and syncing your preferences
  across devices.
* **To Improve Our Service:** Your submissions help us identify proprietary apps that need FOSS
  alternatives.
* **Security & Authentication:** Your email and password are used strictly to secure your account.

We use trusted third-party services to operate our infrastructure. We do not sell your data.

  by contacting us or using the "Delete Account" option within the app settings. Upon deletion, all
  associated account data will be removed from our servers.
